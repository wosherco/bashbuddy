# How do we handle your data?

Other solutions similar to BashBuddy rely on cloud processing, without knowing where your data is going or how it's being used.

BashBuddy is different. We believe that your data should always stay on your own system.

## What data is collected?

BashBuddy runs entirely locally on your device. We don't collect any data from you. _(maybe in the future we'll optionally collect usage data to improve the product, but that will be opt-in)_

## Open Source

All code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wosherco/bashbuddy).

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [contact@bashbuddy.run](mailto:contact@bashbuddy.run).
